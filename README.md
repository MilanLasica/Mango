Mango: Multi-agent based on "Claude Squad" where you can choose from multiple terminal Agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini,...) to finish your code's skeleton

Mango Plus: AI coordinated development to fully deploy your code based on "Claude Flow" where you can take your code and generate the entire AI coordinated development to fully deploy your code with these key benefits & features you'll discover:

    *🐝 Hive-Mind Intelligence**: Experience **queen-led AI coordination* where specialized worker agents (e.g., architect, coder, tester, analyst, researcher, security, DevOps) collaborate and delegate tasks in perfect harmony. This system has *persistent memory* and learns from successful operations, improving performance over time.
    *⚡ Unprecedented Performance**: Mango Plus boasts an **84.8% SWE-Bench solve rate**, currently the highest by over 10%. It offers a **2.8-4.4x speed improvement* due to parallel coordination, maximizing throughput and potentially increasing development speed by *up to 20 times* compared to traditional sequential AI-assisted coding.
    **💰 Significant Cost Reduction**: Efficient task breakdown leads to a **32.3% token reduction**, saving you money.
    *🧠 Neural Networks & Cognitive Models**: Powered by **27+ cognitive models* with WASM SIMD acceleration, enabling pattern recognition, adaptive learning, and explainable AI.
    **🔧 87 Advanced MCP Tools**: A comprehensive toolkit for swarm orchestration, memory, and automation, enhancing your agents' capabilities.
    *💾 Persistent Memory System**: Utilizes an **SQLite database* ( `.swarm/memory.db` with 12 specialized tables) for session resumption, allowing agents to share knowledge and maintain context across development sessions.
    **🔄 Dynamic Agent Architecture (DAA)**: Features self-organizing agents with fault tolerance, resource allocation, and inter-agent communication.
    **🪝 Advanced Hooks System**: Automate workflows with pre- and post-operation hooks for tasks like auto-assigning agents, validating files, formatting code, and updating memory.
    *📊 GitHub Integration**: Offers 6-13 specialized modes and agents for repository analysis, PR management, automated code review, and workflow automation. Includes **GitHub-Enhanced Init* for automatic GitHub releases at checkpoints.
    *🔍 Truth Verification System (NEW)**: Enforces "truth is enforced, not assumed" with mandatory verification and a **0.95 accuracy threshold* for production-ready code. Includes auto-rollback and Byzantine Fault Tolerance.
    **👥 Pair Programming Mode (NEW)**: Facilitates real-time collaborative development with continuous validation between humans and AI.
    **🧠 Training Pipeline (NEW)**: A machine learning system that continuously improves agent performance over time by feeding verification data into training.


*Swarm vs. Hive-Mind:*

    **Swarm Mode**: Ideal for **quick tasks and single objectives**, offering instant setup and auto-spawned agents for temporary coordination. Great for rapid prototyping.
    **Hive-Mind Mode**: Best for **complex projects, persistent sessions, and multi-feature projects**, allowing manual control over specialized agents via an interactive wizard. Perfect for building enterprise systems or full-stack applications.


*Real-World Use Cases:*

    **Rapid Prototyping**: Quickly build proof-of-concept applications.
    **Legacy Code Modernization**: Analyze and update hundreds of files simultaneously.
    **Test Suite Development**: Generate comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests with the TDD mode.
    **Full-Stack Development, Research & Analysis, Security & Compliance**.
